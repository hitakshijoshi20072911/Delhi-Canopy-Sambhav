# 🌳 DelhiCanopy  
### AI Command Center for Urban Green Intelligence

DelhiCanopy is an AI-powered urban climate intelligence platform designed to help governments, planners, and environmental agencies **monitor, analyze, and optimize urban green infrastructure** using geospatial data, machine learning, and predictive analytics.

The system transforms fragmented environmental data into **actionable insights** for tackling heat stress, air pollution, and green cover loss in dense cities like Delhi.

---

## 🚨 Problem Statement

Urban cities such as Delhi face:

- Extreme **heat waves and urban heat islands**
- Rapid **loss of green cover due to construction**
- **Uneven plantation efforts** with little data-backed planning
- Fragmented monitoring systems with **no predictive intelligence**

Despite large-scale plantation drives, there is **no centralized, AI-driven system** that answers:

- Where should trees be planted first?
- Which areas face the highest heat risk?
- Where is illegal tree loss happening?
- What is the real impact of green cover on urban heat?

DelhiCanopy addresses this gap by treating **urban greening as a data and intelligence problem**, not just a policy action.

---

## 💡 Solution Overview

DelhiCanopy functions as a **Geo-Spatial AI Command Center** that:

- Monitors green cover density using satellite imagery
- Maps urban heat stress across wards
- Detects vegetation loss and deforestation risks
- Generates AI-driven plantation strategies
- Provides a visual, map-based decision dashboard

The platform is designed for **government-scale deployment**, while remaining explainable and auditable.

## 🧠 Role of AI & ML

DelhiCanopy uses AI to handle the **complex, multi-variable nature of urban climate systems**, which are impossible to manage manually at city scale.

### AI Techniques Used
- **Computer Vision** for satellite image analysis
- **NDVI / EVI computation** for vegetation health
- **Predictive modeling** for heat stress estimation
- **Change detection models** for tree loss alerts
- **LLM-assisted planning agents** for recommendation generation

### Agentic Workflow (Planned)
- Vision Agent → Detects vegetation change
- Correlation Agent → Links green loss with heat rise
- Strategy Agent → Generates plantation plans

This agent-based approach ensures decisions are **traceable, explainable, and auditable**.
